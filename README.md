# go-closest-warmer-day

## Description
A solution in Golang of an algorithmic task that requires Stack usage.
It's just food for thought for my student.

**Description:**
There is a slice of temperature info for several days. 
Let it be `[13, 12, 15, 11, 9, 12, 16]`. It means that the first day had a temperature of 13 degrees, the second - of 12, the third of 15 and so on...

**Task:** Return a slice where each element is a distance in days to the next warmer one in the slice.
